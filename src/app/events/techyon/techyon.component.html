              <h2>Post Event Report</h2>
              <p>The session was a success, and had good number of participation from 2'nd years.</p>
              <p>All 3 track speakers presented their topics really well. The session was interactive, specially the part which Shayiz covered was interesting and felt almost everyone understood why they should be a part of GLUG.</p>
              <p>In order to keep the session interactive or not so boringðŸ˜†, the members of GEM had organized a game where they had previously stickled chits having numbers from 1 to 100 under the seats of participants and a chit matching this number was randomly drawn, the person who's number matched had to perform a dare. Everyone completed their dare and had a lot of fun.</p>
              <p>The session than continued and Shayiz spoke about the need of being a part of GLUG. We introduced GEM a sub group of GLUG PACE, which purely consists of creative minds of GLUG PACE.</p>
              <p>Also we received many positive feedbacks from the participants regarding the session.</p>    
              <p>Overall the event went well!, and Prof. Hafeez told us about how our seniors used to take GLUG sessions and how we should also continue their legacy.</p>
