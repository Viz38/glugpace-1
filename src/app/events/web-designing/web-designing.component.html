              <h2>Post Event Report</h2>
              <p>The continuation of the previous Web designing workshop was held. There were almost 50 students.</p>
              <p>It started with a brief summary of what was done in the previous class. Then we drectly went to designing our own webpage.</p>
              <p>We made the webpage from scratch using various pictures that were provided to us by Adil.</p>
              <p>We learned how to section the webpage into different parts and create classes to style each of them in seperate way. All of this while making a responsive webpage.</p>
              <p>The workshop concluded at 12:15 and due to lack of time the deployment of the website was not covered. It was decided to do that during one of the weekly non-tech sessions.</p>
