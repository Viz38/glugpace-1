              <p>A treasure hunt is one of many different types of games for players who try to find hidden objects or places by following a series of clues. Treasure hunt games may be an indoor or outdoor activity. Outdoors it can be played in a garden, indoors it can be played in a specific room, which would make the work of hiding the clues harder.</p>

              <h2>Rules: </h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>The Treasure Hunt consists of 4-5 clues, each one leading to the next clue. Each correctly solved clue carries 10 points. And final Treasure carries 50 points.</li>
                  <li>For now, The Treasure Hunt is limited to Engineering Students.</li>
                  <li>The clues are to be found in a particular order. A person cannot skip a clue. Skipping a clue leads to disqualification.</li>
                  <li>After each clue is solved, inform any one of the coordinators (Adil, Shakir & Vishnu).</li>
                  <li>Do not search for clues in off-limit areas.</li>
                  <li>A person may use smartphones or any internet devices.</li>
                  <li>Do not move, tamper with or destroy any physical object.</li>
                  <li>And most importantly use your brain.</li>
              </ul>
